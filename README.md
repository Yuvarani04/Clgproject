MENTAL HEALTH PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING 


This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict mental health conditions, such as depression, based on user data. By preprocessing a mental health dataset and applying classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, the system identifies patterns and predicts whether an individual is at risk. The goal is to support early diagnosis and intervention through data-driven insights.
